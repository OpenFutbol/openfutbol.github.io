cd openfutbol.github.io

# Install dependencies
bundle install

# Start local development server
bundle exec jekyll serve

# Visit http://localhost:4000
```

### File Structure
```
‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ index.html                 # Main pickup finder (Chicago)
‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ chicago-pickup-soccer.html # SEO-optimized Chicago page
‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ _config.yml               # Jekyll configuration
‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ Gemfile                   # Dependencies
‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ README.md                 # This file
‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ robots.txt               # SEO configuration
‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ assets/img/              # Images and logos
‚îî‚îÄ‚îÄ .github/workflows/       # GitHub Pages deployment
```

### Development Notes
- Site auto-reloads on file changes during development
- All CSS is inline in HTML files for simplicity
- Interactive map uses vanilla JavaScript

## üåê GitHub Pages Deployment

### How it Works
OpenFutbol automatically deploys to GitHub Pages using GitHub Actions:

1. **Push to `main` branch** triggers automatic deployment
2. **Jekyll builds** the static site from your HTML/CSS/JS
3. **GitHub Actions** deploys to `https://openfutbol.github.io`
4. **Global CDN** serves your site worldwide

### Timeline
- **Code push ‚Üí build start**: Immediate
- **Build completion**: 1-5 minutes
- **Global deployment**: 5-10 minutes for worldwide CDN

### Success Indicators
- ‚úÖ Green checkmark in GitHub Actions tab
- ‚úÖ New commit SHA in GitHub Pages settings
- ‚úÖ Site accessible at openfutbol.github.io

### Troubleshooting Failed Builds
If deployment fails:
1. **Check GitHub Actions tab** for error details
2. **Test locally first**: `bundle exec jekyll serve`
3. **Common issues**: Missing frontmatter, invalid YAML in `_config.yml`
4. **Verify file structure**: Ensure `index.html` exists in root

### Best Practices
- **Test locally** before pushing to main
- **Small commits** for easier debugging
- **Monitor GitHub Actions** after pushing
- **Check build logs** if deployment fails
